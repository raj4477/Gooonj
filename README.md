# Gooonj: Break The Silence
![Pink and Grey Blob Business Hip Project Report Video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97554714/226507865-c77c2949-b855-4e6b-8ea9-14b4e93e4ad4.jpeg)
## Inspiration!

1. Personal experience:
We had always wondered why our mothers and sisters were treated differently after a few days. As we grew older, we learned about the horrible customs that pervaded our culture and how they affected the lives of impoverished and disadvantaged women. We sought a platform for providing these women with safety, security, and a healthy way of life.

2. Passion for social justice and gender equality: The bigger concerns of gender equality and reproductive rights are frequently entwined with smaller ones of menstrual health. We are deeply concerned about these problems and wanted to promote menstrual health as a means of addressing more extensive structural injustices.
## What it does:
Gooonj is a platform that provides users with Sanitary pads that they can use during their menstrual cycle. Depending upon the user they can either use the Gooonj card or the Gooonj app to dispense the sanitary pads. After the pad has been dispensed they are asked about their health condition in a yes/no question section within the vending machine's interactive screen. The user's response is analyzed which points to the current health condition of the women. If any health anomalies are detected it will generate an alert in the admin's console which will basically be the health worker of that locality so that the health worker would take the necessary action to insure the women's safety.

##  How we built it
1. Ideation:
we brainstormed continuously for hours to optimal solutions for removing stigma related to mensuration from our society using Gooonj
2. Research and study:
we approached concerned medical authorities regarding the problems, and symptoms regarding the menstrual health cycle and we also approached active NGOs and INGO

3. User interfacing:
We tried to build a UI for users in a friendly and convenient manner in both hardware and software ends.

4. Prototype (hardware and software):
    - basic hardware component implementation. 
    - implemented user interfaces for various platforms

5. Implementing (hardware and software):
we integrated the front-end and back-end in our app and hardware as well as using Firebase and custom backend
## Challenges we ran into:
1. Stigma and shame:
Despite progress in recent years, menstruation is still often considered a taboo subject and is surrounded by shame and stigma. it made it really difficult for us to approach people without a project concept

2. getting the proper hardware components:
It was really difficult for us to test different hardware components and get the desired effect from them
3. Lack of data:
    There is a lack of comprehensive data on menstrual health, 
    which makes it difficult to understand the scope of the problem 
    and develop effective solutions. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of:
1) we build a platform that was able to address the problem faced by women during their menstrual cycle by providing them with proper health care when needed.
2) Gooonj covers the needs of both Urban and rural women.
3) Improved access to menstrual products. 
4) Increased awareness and education.
## What's next for Gooonj
1) scale Gooonj to the national level.
2) add better disease prediction techniques using enhanced analytic and neural network
3) Reach out to every needy woman.
