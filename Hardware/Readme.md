## Component used
1. Arduino Mega 2560
2. Esp-32 devkit
3. RC522 RFID Card Reader
4. (0.96 Inch) I2C/IIC 128x64 OLED Display

## Description
 The circuit consists of  Esp-32 with Arduino Mega 2560 along with UART communication between them. We used Esp-32 to connect with internet and our custom backend. We used arduino mega to be used as an interface between esp-32 and hardware. As it was our first prototype, we tried to minimize the complexity of the hardware circuit by not adding any custom made PCBs and hardware components.
